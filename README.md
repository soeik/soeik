# Hi, I'm Kirill (aka soeik) 🦔

**Frontend Architect | Product-Minded Engineer | Bridge Builder**

I’m an engineer who enjoys getting to the heart of things. I specialize in transforming chaotic business requirements into clean, elegant, and human-centric interfaces. 

I believe that behind every green CI/CD indicator stands a real person, and my mission is to be their advocate in the codebase.

### What I’m up to:
- 🏗️ Architecting frontend ecosystems at **Gazprombank**.
- 🛠️ Mastering **React / Redux / TypeScript** for large-scale enterprise.
- 📱 Developing a mobile journal app with **React Native**.
- 🎹 Producing **Melodic House** and practicing **operatic vocals**.

### Beyond the Code:
I’m a big fan of analog aesthetics. When I'm not in VS Code, you'll likely find me with a film camera or at my piano. I find that music and photography keep my "empathy muscle" strong, which directly informs how I build software.
